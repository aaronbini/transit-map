# transit-map
### Ideas
- Change color of dot based on current speed, speed determined by previous lat/long vs current
  - Use RxJS for all data processing
- Move the dot between positions smoothly instead of just jumping from Position A to B
- Train and Bus will have different markers
- Focus on the styling
  - One "map" should be totally blank (just points moving around the screen)
  - One should show roads only
  - One should show everything but be styled in an interesting way
  - Future map: show current congestion on major roads
